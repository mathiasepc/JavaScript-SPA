                    I’m a structured and detail-oriented developer with an interest in systems integration,
                    automation and clean, maintainable code. I enjoy working with debugging and data optimization,
                    especially when it involves improving data flows and building solutions that are efficient and
                    easy to maintain. I have experience with full-stack development and integration projects which
                    gives me an understanding of system architecture and data handling across layers. I thrive in
                    dynamic environments where I can take ownership, dive into complex problems and collaborate
                    closely with both developers and stakeholders to deliver robust, reliable solutions.

                    I’m running a Raspberry Pi 5 with a 16 GB SD card, which I use as a web server.
                    On the Raspberry Pi, I’ve disabled the root user and enabled SSH access using an
                    SSH key. File and directory permissions are configured with read/write access
                    only where necessary, and only essential ports are open on the router.

                    The server hosts a website running on Nginx, which is protected behind a Caddy
                    reverse proxy. Caddy also manages my SSL certificates and enforces security and
                    privacy headers.

                    I’ve set up a Docker environment with multiple containers connected through a
                    shared Docker network, exposing only a single external port. The containers are
                    managed using Docker Compose.

                    I plan to deploy two REST APIs for testing — one in Java and one in C#.
                    For data storage, I’m using PostgreSQL, and I plan to integrate Cloudflare for
                    additional security and performance.
