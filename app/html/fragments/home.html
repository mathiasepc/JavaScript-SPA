                    I’m a structured and detail-oriented developer with an interest in systems integration,
                    automation and clean, maintainable code. I enjoy working with debugging and data optimization,
                    especially when it involves improving data flows and building solutions that are efficient and
                    easy to maintain. I have experience with full-stack development and integration projects which
                    gives me an understanding of system architecture and data handling across layers. I thrive in
                    dynamic environments where I can take ownership, dive into complex problems and collaborate
                    closely with both developers and stakeholders to deliver robust, reliable solutions.

                    I’m running a Raspberry Pi 5 with a 16 GB SD card, which I use as a web server. On my Raspberry Pi, I’ve
                    disabled the root user and enabled SSH access using an SSH key. File and folder permissions are configured
                    with read/write access only where necessary, and only essential ports are open. On this server, I’ve deployed
                    a webpage running on an Nginx server, which is protected behind a Caddy reverse proxy. I’ve set up a Docker
                    environment with multiple containers on a shared Docker network so only one external port is exposed, managed
                    via docker-compose. Soon I plan to deploy two REST APIs for testing — one in Java and one in C#. For data
                    storage, I’m using PostgreSQL, and I plan to integrate Cloudflare.
